title: Convos 1.0 beta
---

We can finally announce Convos 1.0 beta! It is already running on
[demo.convos.by](/#demo), so if you're feeling adventurous you
can try it out there.

This new version has been completely rebuilt from ground up, meaning almost
none of the original code is part of the new project. The downside with that
is that it's not even close to being compatible with the old version: There's
simply no Redis backend! This means that the old log messages will not be
converted to the new file-based backend - unless someone writes a script to
convert the old storage to plain text files.

### Browser support

Convos use [vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) to render the frontend and WebSockets
to communicate with backend. This means that it will work on Internet Explorer
9 and above, as well as other modern browsers.

The design is based on [Material Design](http://materializecss.com/), and
works just as well on a mobile as on your desktop.

### Status

Convos is almost feature complete, compared to the old code base, but the code
is much younger, so there are probably a bunch of bugs - hence the "beta" tag
on the [stable](https://github.com/Nordaaker/convos/tree/stable) release.

Have a look at GitHub issue [#265](https://github.com/Nordaaker/convos/issues/265)
for more details.

### Stats

Here are some stats generated by [cloc](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc):

| Language     | Files | Comment | Code |
| ------------ | ----- | ------- | -----|
| &nbsp; Perl  |    15 |     665 | 1579 |
| + JavaScript |    22 |      69 | 1327 |
| + SASS       |    11 |      21 |  622 |
| = SUM        |    48 |     755 | 3528 |

Its amazing how little code that is required, when you build on top of
[CPAN](http://metacpan.org).

Thanks!
