Convos is a persistent IRC client that you can use from any web browser. After
twenty-some years of using ircII or irssi running in screen on my server, I've
become a happy user of Convos (for the past few years).

I'll be honest - it took me a while to get used to a web-based client, and
there are still some ircII features that I miss sometimes. But there's also an
upside. It's much easier to hack on Convos to make it do things you want. And
it's such a relief that Unicode text just... works! Like magic!

Convos is a sophisticated application written in Perl using the
[Mojolicious](https://mojolicious.org/) real-time web framework with a
[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) frontend and extensive tests. It's a great
example of modern web development, it's fun to hack on, and it has friendly and
responsive maintainers.

Today was a Convos hackathon, and I took the opportunity to submit a few small
[pull requests](https://github.com/Nordaaker/convos/pulls?q=author%3Aamenonsen),
which were reviewed and merged promptly.
