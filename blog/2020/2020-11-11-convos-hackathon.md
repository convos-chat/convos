Interested in hacking on Convos and learning more about the design?  We will
have a hackathon on the 21st of November 00:00 CET, until 15:00 CET.

Since this is a world-wide hackathon people might join and leave during the
timeframe, but the core developers will be active in the #convos channel on
irc.freenode.net, answering questions and teaming up on different components
that *you* want to build.

If you are interested in attending, please contact us at
[contact@convos.chat](mailto:contact@convos.chat) and provide the
following information:

* Your nickname on irc.freenode.net.
* What time you can join, including timezone.
* Which part of Convos do you want to hack on: Frontend, backend, plugins or
  other bugs, components or features.
* Other relevant information you can think of.

Because of timezones, there won't be any fixed schedule, but we might do ad-hoc
video conference using [Jitsi](https://meet.jit.si/) or
[Google Hangouts](https://hangouts.google.com/),

Please have a look at the following resources before joining:

* [Convos developement guide](https://convos.chat/doc/develop)
* [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
* [Mojolicious](https://mojolicious.org/)
* [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
* [Perl](https://docs.mojolicious.org/#BASICS)

Don't know what to hack on, but interested in helping anyway? Maybe you can:

* Improve the documentation on the official website or the Convos application.
* Discuss how onboarding (creating a new account) could be more user friendly.
* Create new
  [themes](https://convos.chat/blog/2020/6/14/create-your-own-theme-detailed-walkthrough),
  or extend the set of variables to enable your theme to be built.

We also have open [issues](https://github.com/Nordaaker/convos/issues) and
ideas in the [fridge](https://github.com/Nordaaker/convos/issues?q=milestone%3AFridge).

Looking forward to talking to you on the 21st!
